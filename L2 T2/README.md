This project uses chemical analysis to predict the quality ratings of wine samples.

## 🍷 Dataset Description
The dataset includes properties such as:
- **Volatile Acidity**: Acetic acid content (too high leads to vinegar taste).
- **Citric Acid**: Adds freshness.
- **Residual Sugar**: Amount of sugar remaining after fermentation.
- **Sulphates**: Wine additives which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas levels.
- **Alcohol**: The percent content of alcohol.
- **Quality**: The target variable (score between 0 and 10).

## 🛠️ Requirements

%pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn
